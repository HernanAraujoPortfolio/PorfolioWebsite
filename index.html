							<h1></h1>
							<p>Welcome to my portfolio, I hope to share enough information about myself and also display my love and passion for game development.
								As a self taught developer I've dabbled in several developing professions, but specialize in game programming and design. I was a UI Layout for a mobile app called "Zoo Country" on IOS (picture bellow on the right). 
								After this I focused on self teaching, creating projects and laying out ideas. I then moved to Vancouver to pursue my career, where I worked at Electronic Arts and successfully helped launch Fifa 20. I held ownership/lead the Volta Stability Team 
								as a "Development Support" this was a very new and exciting game mode for Fifa20 and it was an honour to have a great part in it.</p>
								<div style="text-align: left;"><p><img src ="images/Fifa20.jpg"/>

								<p>Bellow youll find a few of my current projects and then my resume</p>

									<h2>Project Rune</h2 >
									<p>Currently attempting to finish and launch this project. This will be one of my first solo launches on the android play store. This is an Idle Adventure Game,
										with one of the key features being that the player can walk back to previous parts of the world to reclaim and discover new dungeons, fight powerful creatures and reap the rewards.
										No launch date has been set yet.

									<h2>Slip And Slide</h2>
									<p>A prototype for a mobile game idea I had as a proof of concept.The idea is,
										players must go from one point of the map and reach the end of the map
										without getting touched by enemies(White Cubes). Adapt, be quick and push forward. Can you make it to the end ?
